This program is just a brute force approach of creating mCQs from text articles. I plan on improving my project and have some key
ideas on how to do so. They are as follows:

	1) The questions of the present program are of the fill in the blanks format, so furthur changes can be made to the 
	program to yeild questions of other formats such as True/False, questions containing what/when/why, multiple correct options
	etc. 

	2) The parameters of various models and extractors can be twitched to obtained improved quality of questions as well
	as options.

	3) We can summarize the whole text using some type of summarizer in order to obtain only the crucial part of 
	the text. This will help us in framing questions only from the important section of the article.

	4) Decide the ideal number of questions for the MCQ based on the text article provided.

	5) Use other libraries such as RAKE and word2vec and see if they yeild better quality MCQ.

These are some of the improvement ideas that I could think of and am trying to implement to my code. I am sure there are far 
better approaches and I am always on the lookout for such approaches to achieve the best possible solution to this problem. Like 
it is said, there is always a room for improvement. :)
