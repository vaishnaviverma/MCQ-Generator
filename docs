Step 1 – Import the text file/article:
Firstly, we will import the text file/article that has to be used for the MCQ generation with the
help if open and read functions.
Step 2 – Extraction of important word (keywords):
In this step, we try to extract the most important words, also known as keywords, in our text
article that will result in quality questions. These keywords will act as the answer to questions and will
be a part of the 4 options, the other 3 being the wrong options.
To do this, we use Python Keyphrase Extraction (PKE). The PKE that we use in this project is from
an open source github repository that allows us to find keywords. This uses a multipartite unsupervised
model to extract keywords. Multipartition ensure the efficiency of the extraction. So, in this process we
get the best 25 keyphrases/keywords from our text article.
